It was thought that you either stumbled onto it or you didn’t. It wasn’t until the 17th century that the word began its association with pleasure and contentment./nEven the Greeks and the Romans who introduced us to Classical philosophy would have shrugged at the modern notion of happiness. To them, happiness was indeed the chief aim in life, but they had a very different definition of what the term actually meant./nRather than seeing it as an emotional state, their idea of a happy life was built on something more. It wasn’t an event. It was about a life lived in harmony with our own nature, including the acceptance of suffering and discomfort./nIf you ask the average person today what they want out of life, the majority will tell you that they want to be happy. If you dig deeper into what they mean, they’ll tell that they want to feel good and comfortable and be at ease./nOn the surface, that sounds innocent enough, but the reality is that this pursuit of happiness is actually the cause of much of our misery./nThe notion that pleasure and contentment are the solution to all of life’s problems, and that once you acquire these states you have everything you need, is misguided at best and dangerous at worst./nThere is more to life than happiness./nI consider myself a reasonably happy person. On most days, there is a general baseline that I don’t deviate too far away from for too long. I’m quite fortunate in many ways, and I’m more than grateful for that./nI have enough. I don’t need to be filthy rich. I don’t care for fame. I’ve come to terms with the fact that comparing myself to others is a waste of time, and I don’t want to get stuck chasing hedonistic temptations for the rest of my life. There is nothing more that I realistically need./nYet, I write. And when I write, I want it to be good, and I want people to read it. I have my general ambitions, and there are things I want to accomplish. I work quite hard, and it’s not always fun. But if I’m already content, why?/nBecause I know that if I didn’t have any sort of desire for something more, then I would cease to feel content./nThe reason is simple. The cause of my happiness isn’t that I have enough, but it’s that I have worked to get to a point where I have enough. It’s not that I woke one morning not caring what someone thinks or deciding that hedonistic pleasures weren’t important, it’s that I spent a lot of time thinking those things were important, suffered for it, and then worked to make them unimportant. The difference is subtle, but critical./nMy happiness isn’t a product of me getting what I want. It’s the byproduct of the different challenges I have proactively overcome to earn what I want. It’s the expectations I have met or readjusted over time./nI need something to work at to get it. If I stopped pursing things tomorrow, my lingering happiness would escape. Over time, it would cease to mean anything, and I wouldn’t be able to refuel it by simply wishing for more./nDue to its fleeing nature, happiness alone isn’t enough./nIn many ways, humans can be characterized as biological algorithms. It’s not an entirely perfect analogy, but it works quite well to explain our behavior./nWe respond to stressors in our environment, which is the /n, by manipulating ourselves through a /n as to give us an edge that presents itself in the form of an /n. Over the long-term, how well we do this determines our ability to thrive./nIn the modern world, we have a lot of choice in terms of the exposure that we want to give ourselves to these stressors. Most of us could easily go through life trying to avoid significant challenges that arise in our environment, but that requires a form of escapism, and it’s not necessarily a healthy thing./nYou may be able to temporarily avoid a fight with your partner or to remove yourself from the desire to work towards a goal, but eventually, something will give. At some point, discomfort invites itself./nWhile happiness is best defined as a state of being content, we didn’t actually evolve to be content. We evolved to strive and to struggle and to compete, so by nature, we don’t get rewarded for being consistently happy./nAlthough some parts of society have taken these characteristics to their extreme in how they incentivize the systems and corporations around us, this intrinsic want for more isn’t something we can just shut off. We need to be better and to make progress and to feel more than just enough./nThis means chasing some ambition, taking on pain, and exposing ourselves to slight variances in emotional states. Doing these things in extremes isn’t the solution, but deviating away from a comfortable median is what actually allows us to maintain a baseline that we can refer to as happiness./nWithout struggling against something, enough would cease to be enough./nHappiness isn’t obtained. It’s earned. It’s not the product. It’s the byproduct./nFor this reason, the idea that some serene state of bliss can be sustained with pleasure and contentment, although seductive, is misguided. Over the long-term, it takes more than that. It takes a sense of striving./nGratitude is important, to be sure, and so is being well-adjusted enough to not seek out extrinsic motivators to provide a solution, but these things alone will only take you so far. The real secret is to live a story./nIt’s to create a narrative that appropriately incentivizes you to choose a level of discomfort and suffering necessary for sustaining a deeper fulfillment. That will actually keep you in motion. That’s what makes the difference./nIn/n, Nietzsche wrote,/nFor the painter, it’s the 10 years spent in front of the canvas practicing without any hope of a making a dime because she knows what it’s like to look at a Van Gogh painting and feel something that can’t be described./nFor the entrepreneur, it’s the sleepless nights and the gut-wrenching risks taken to bring a product to market because that’s the kind of challenge and uncertainty that makes him better today than he was yesterday./nThe narrative you tell will determine the kind of hurdles your life invites, and clearing these hurdles is ultimately what gives the emotions you feel any sort of real meaning. That’s how their value is earned./nIf you take care of the story, happiness doesn’t need to be enough. You get something better. You get sustained fulfillment./nI write at /n.

It was thought that you either stumbled onto it or you didn’t. It wasn’t until the 17th century that the word began its association with pleasure and contentment./nEven the Greeks and the Romans who introduced us to Classical philosophy would have shrugged at the modern notion of happiness. To them, happiness was indeed the chief aim in life, but they had a very different definition of what the term actually meant./nRather than seeing it as an emotional state, their idea of a happy life was built on something more. It wasn’t an event. It was about a life lived in harmony with our own nature, including the acceptance of suffering and discomfort./nIf you ask the average person today what they want out of life, the majority will tell you that they want to be happy. If you dig deeper into what they mean, they’ll tell that they want to feel good and comfortable and be at ease./nOn the surface, that sounds innocent enough, but the reality is that this pursuit of happiness is actually the cause of much of our misery./nThe notion that pleasure and contentment are the solution to all of life’s problems, and that once you acquire these states you have everything you need, is misguided at best and dangerous at worst./nThere is more to life than happiness./nI consider myself a reasonably happy person. On most days, there is a general baseline that I don’t deviate too far away from for too long. I’m quite fortunate in many ways, and I’m more than grateful for that./nI have enough. I don’t need to be filthy rich. I don’t care for fame. I’ve come to terms with the fact that comparing myself to others is a waste of time, and I don’t want to get stuck chasing hedonistic temptations for the rest of my life. There is nothing more that I realistically need./nYet, I write. And when I write, I want it to be good, and I want people to read it. I have my general ambitions, and there are things I want to accomplish. I work quite hard, and it’s not always fun. But if I’m already content, why?/nBecause I know that if I didn’t have any sort of desire for something more, then I would cease to feel content./nThe reason is simple. The cause of my happiness isn’t that I have enough, but it’s that I have worked to get to a point where I have enough. It’s not that I woke one morning not caring what someone thinks or deciding that hedonistic pleasures weren’t important, it’s that I spent a lot of time thinking those things were important, suffered for it, and then worked to make them unimportant. The difference is subtle, but critical./nMy happiness isn’t a product of me getting what I want. It’s the byproduct of the different challenges I have proactively overcome to earn what I want. It’s the expectations I have met or readjusted over time./nI need something to work at to get it. If I stopped pursing things tomorrow, my lingering happiness would escape. Over time, it would cease to mean anything, and I wouldn’t be able to refuel it by simply wishing for more./nDue to its fleeing nature, happiness alone isn’t enough./nIn many ways, humans can be characterized as biological algorithms. It’s not an entirely perfect analogy, but it works quite well to explain our behavior./nWe respond to stressors in our environment, which is the /n, by manipulating ourselves through a /n as to give us an edge that presents itself in the form of an /n. Over the long-term, how well we do this determines our ability to thrive./nIn the modern world, we have a lot of choice in terms of the exposure that we want to give ourselves to these stressors. Most of us could easily go through life trying to avoid significant challenges that arise in our environment, but that requires a form of escapism, and it’s not necessarily a healthy thing./nYou may be able to temporarily avoid a fight with your partner or to remove yourself from the desire to work towards a goal, but eventually, something will give. At some point, discomfort invites itself./nWhile happiness is best defined as a state of being content, we didn’t actually evolve to be content. We evolved to strive and to struggle and to compete, so by nature, we don’t get rewarded for being consistently happy./nAlthough some parts of society have taken these characteristics to their extreme in how they incentivize the systems and corporations around us, this intrinsic want for more isn’t something we can just shut off. We need to be better and to make progress and to feel more than just enough./nThis means chasing some ambition, taking on pain, and exposing ourselves to slight variances in emotional states. Doing these things in extremes isn’t the solution, but deviating away from a comfortable median is what actually allows us to maintain a baseline that we can refer to as happiness./nWithout struggling against something, enough would cease to be enough./nHappiness isn’t obtained. It’s earned. It’s not the product. It’s the byproduct./nFor this reason, the idea that some serene state of bliss can be sustained with pleasure and contentment, although seductive, is misguided. Over the long-term, it takes more than that. It takes a sense of striving./nGratitude is important, to be sure, and so is being well-adjusted enough to not seek out extrinsic motivators to provide a solution, but these things alone will only take you so far. The real secret is to live a story./nIt’s to create a narrative that appropriately incentivizes you to choose a level of discomfort and suffering necessary for sustaining a deeper fulfillment.

It was thought that you either stumbled onto it or you didn’t. It wasn’t until the 17th century that the word began its association with pleasure and contentment./nEven the Greeks and the Romans who introduced us to Classical philosophy would have shrugged at the modern notion of happiness. To them, happiness was indeed the chief aim in life, but they had a very different definition of what the term actually meant./nRather than seeing it as an emotional state, their idea of a happy life was built on something more. It wasn’t an event.

On most days, there is a general baseline that I don’t deviate too far away from for too long. I’m quite fortunate in many ways, and I’m more than grateful for that./nI have enough.

The cause of my happiness isn’t that I have enough, but it’s that I have worked to get to a point where I have enough. It’s not that I woke one morning not caring what someone thinks or deciding that hedonistic pleasures weren’t important, it’s that I spent a lot of time thinking those things were important, suffered for it, and then worked to make them unimportant.

https://medium.com/tabu/the-truth-about-identifying-as-asexual-in-the-midwest-7219b99e2850	Arielle	The truth about identifying as asexual in the Midwest	ayla Fields was the school prude of Bedford North Lawrence High School. She dated a handful of boys who pursued her, but the relationships never lasted more than a week. It wasn’t that she didn’t want to be in a relationship, she just cared more about watching /n than experimenting with French kissing./nAfter graduation, Fields tested the sexual waters. She made out with a middle-aged man who attacked her neck like a vampire, fooled around with her best friend’s boyfriend’s best friend and sexted with a girl she met online. It all felt forced. She wasn’t swimming; Fields was drowning./nAt first, she thought she was a lesbian. That didn’t make sense, she reasoned, because women didn’t excite her sexually either. She had to be bisexual. At least, that’s what Fields told her disapproving mom. There was no other explanation for what Fields was feeling. Or rather, what she wasn’t feeling./nA few clicks later, Fields found herself scanning through forums on the /n (AVEN). Suddenly, it all made sense. Fields wasn’t heterosexual. She wasn’t homosexual or bisexual either. In fact, according to AVEN, she wasn’t sexually attracted to anyone — she was asexual./nThe crystalizing moment was soon clouded by self-doubt. “Am I going to be alone forever?” Fields thought. “I don’t know anyone who identifies as asexual.”/nBefore AVEN launched in 2001, asexuality was relatively unheard of. Like Fields, many confused individuals turned to the Internet for answers and stumbled into the comforting arms of the virtual community. Since its inception, AVEN has helped tens of thousands of isolated people around the world discover their elusive sexual orientation together./nImmersed in a network of hundreds of thousands of like-minded people, Fields realized she wasn’t an anomaly. She swallowed the lump in her throat, and removed her cloak of invisibility./nIn 2013, the same year that Fields joined AVEN, asexuality was no longer considered a sexual dysfunction. While stripped of medial bias, lingering myths continue to reject asexuality from joining heterosexuality, homosexuality and bisexuality as the “fourth sex.” Today, more asexuals like Fields are emerging from the shadows to fight for their visibility./nBleeding red, Indiana is an unlikely heartland for sexual research. But it was in the small town of Bloomington where Dr. Alfred Kinsey became one of the first researchers to discover asexuality. At the time, the father of sexology didn’t know what to make of it./n, published in the 1948 and 1953 Kinsey Reports, rated sexuality on a seven-point scale. Zero was exclusively heterosexual, six was exclusively homosexual, and a separate category “X” was used to describe those with “no socio-sexual contact or reaction.”/nThe report’s titillating statistics on other American sexual behaviors, like homosexuality, overshadowed group “X,” keeping the minority in the dark and away from the sexual revolution. Following research sporadically mentioned asexuality, but it would be another 65 years before the orientation was purposefully investigated./nThree years after AVEN launched, Dr. Anthony F. Bogaert, a psychology professor at Brock University, sparked national attention and media coverage on asexuality. Using preexisting data from a 1994 study, the Canadian suggested that one in 100 people identifies as asexual, and that they share a handful of traits, including height, weight, low socio-economic status and a high degree of religiousness./n“Bogaert’s [2004] study makes no sense at all,” said Dr. Nicole Prause, CEO of Liberos. According to Prause and Dr. Cynthia Graham, the groundbreaking work had several limitations. Subjects were identified as asexual if they agreed with the statement: “I have never felt sexually attracted to anyone at all.” That was the Canadian’s biggest mistake — emphasizing desire over identity and behavior./nTo correct Bogaert’s flaw in his initial paper, Prause and Graham conducted a more comprehensive study where the field of research began — the /n. This time, the researchers were prepared to analyze the elusive group “X.” Using self-reports, they distinguished characteristics between the sexual and non-sexual to better understand the uncharted orientation,/n“Asexuality is interesting as an extreme end of the spectrum [of asexuality}],” Prause said. “We can’t understand the phenomenon until we can explain both ends.”/nThe results rejected Bogaert’s on almost all counts. Asexuals aren’t less educated than sexuals, nor do they differ in number of lifetime partners. The most unforeseen inconsistency is that some aces engage in sexual activity, which suggests the libido is separate from sexual attraction./nAbout once a month, Fields masturbates to porn. When she gets bored of watching people have sex, she finishes to whatever is on TV. It’s not mind-blowing, she explains, because rubbing one out is more like itching a scratch. “I have a libido and my body can get aroused like anyone else’s,” she said. “I just don’t have the feeling to sleep with anyone or get taken care of.”/nPrause and Bogaert’s research challenged the American Psychiatric Association’s classification of sexual disorders. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-4) lumped asexuality under Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder, preventing the orientation from ever being recognized as the fourth sex. But asexuality isn’t a sexual dysfunction, the sexologists argued, because aces don’t experience “marked distress” and “interpersonal difficult” because of a lack of “sexual fantasies and desire for sexual activity.”/nIn 2008, AVEN seized the opportunity to reclassify HSDD in an updated version of the manual. The goal was to help draft a new definition for the dysfunction that didn’t pathologize asexuality. Five years later, marginalized individuals all over the world celebrated a step towards visibility. Asexuality officially embarked on the road to societal acceptance, but the destination laid miles ahead./nFields clocks in for work at 7:53 p.m. Five days a week, she mops up oil and takes out the trash. It’s not a glamorous job, but she’s fine with it. She needs the money to support her mom, and paying for medication out of pocket is expensive./nWhen she graduated from Ivy Tech, Fields never imagined herself working as a janitor at Cook Polymore Technology. She’s not miserable, though. Not yet, she says. But sweeping the floor isn’t what she went to school for./n“When I tell people my dream job they give me a look like my grandma died or something,” Fields said./nShe wants to be a full time artist, but that’s hard to achieve in a state where the employment isn’t great. If it weren’t for her family, she’d leave Indiana. But for now, her mom needs her in Bedford to help her cope with her mental illness. While she adjusts to new medicine, Fields takes care of the house and pays the bills./n“We’re just trying to survive everyday,” Fields said./nLike any roommates, Fields and her mom inevitably quarrel from time to time. “She’s a religious Christian and I have more of a pagan perspective,” Fields said. “I definitely don’t agree with her beliefs.”/nThe first time Fields came out as bisexual, it was hard for her mom to understand. The second time she came out as asexual, her mom was more accepting./nFields identifies as grey-demi romantic asexual. “Grey romantic means that someone can experience romantic attraction, but on rare occasion,” she explained. “I also identify as demi romantic, because in order to make a romantic relationship stick I have to have a strong bond with somebody.”/nLooks are definitely a bonus, but that’s not what makes Fields’ heart thump. It’s the personality that does it, but that’s hard to convey on a dating website. Nevertheless, she flipped through profiles in search of a glasses wearing, dead baby joke telling, /nwatching asexual partner. Ideally, one who is also into BDSM./n“For a lot of people, BDSM is like a sexual power exchange,” Fields said. “But when asexuals are into BDSM, it’s more like we arouse our minds.”/nThree years ago, Fields hit the jackpot. She found an asexual girl who was also kinky. After a year of Facebook messaging and texting, Anna Hastings surprised Fields at her college graduation. They spent the weekend celebrating their one-year anniversary traipsing around Bedford with arms locked./n“Anna is a very romantic person,” Fields said. “I don’t mind doing romantic things for her because she makes me feel comfortable.”/nAlthough they’re both on BDSM dating sites, Fields says they won’t necessarily engage in it. Just knowing someone was into the same things as her was thrilling. “Most of my life is online because there aren’t that many asexuals to talk to,” Fields said. “It was exciting knowing I wasn’t alone and actually meeting someone face to face.”/nExplaining her asexuality got difficult when her male coworkers found out she was in a relationship. If Fields didn’t want to have sex with them but was dating a girl, she must be a lesbian. “Yeah I’m into girls,” Fields said. “But not the way you’re into girls.” Still, they thought she was lying. It became exasperating to talk about./nFields knows asexuality will eventually be accepted in society, just like homosexuality. It will quietly be normalized, she says, because asexuals don’t do anything scandalous with their bodies that would attract attention. They don’t make big waves. Not yet, anyway./nIn a society that chants “sex sells,” asexuality is seldom seen in the entertainment industry. This poor representation delegitimizes asexuality and reflects a lack of general public understanding of the orientation. And without characters or narratives to relate to in mainstream media, aces feel even more isolated and rejected from society./nWhen aces are represented in popular shows, they’re usually depicted as broken. In the case of BBC’s /n, actor Benedict Cumberbatch, who plays detective Sherlock Holmes, explained that the protagonist is only asexual because his sex drive was suppressed. “Cold showers, dead bodies, that’ll do it for you,” Cumberbatch told Elle UK Magazine./nFields says she’s never been a huge fan of /n, but not because it isn’t a well written show. “They make Sherlock almost seem like he’s socially unequipped, like being ace is the butt of a joke.”/nIn the /nasexual/ncharacter Sheldon Cooper is portrayed as a brilliant theoretical physicist who lacks empathy. The majority of the sitcom’s humor revolves around Sheldon’s lack of social skills and odd character traits. Like /n, asexuality is represented in the TV series as a peculiar consequence of behavior, rather than a celebrated orientation./nIn 2015, Archie Comics writer Chip Zdarsky confirmed what all asexuals wanted to believe — Jughead Jones is asexual. Since the crown wearing character first appeared in Pep Comics in1941, Jughead was known for his love affair with food and general disinterest in pursuing any kind of romantic relationship./nLast year the CW announced it would air a TV adaptation of the Archie Comics, giving optimistic asexuals a chance of positive representation. However, in Episode 6 of /n, Jughead surprised viewers by kissing Betty. With one spit swap, he /n./nLike most aces, Fields was infuriated. Her chance for a better media representation was shot. But not all hope was lost. Before coming out as ace, Fields also dabbled with her asexuality./n“It makes sense that he doesn’t automatically know he’s ace,” Fields said. “Most people don’t recognize they’re different until high school.”/nMany asexuals turned to Twitter to express their disdain for Jughead’s development/nTo quell the uproar, show runner Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa explained that Riverdale characters are just discovering their sexuality in season one. With nothing set in stone, Fields is hopeful the show will come to represent her orientation and catalyze future positive depictions./n“Asexual people had to pretty much scream at the industry to represent them,” she said. “But we’re starting to scratch the surface, especially more than when I first identified.”/nIt was hot and their pale skin was about to crisp. They forgot to wear sunblock on their outing to the Harry Potter themed amusement park, so Fields bought two black umbrellas from a gift shop. Under the shade, they laid in the grass and gazed at each other./n“You’re cute,” Hastings said./nHer cheeks blushed in response. “It wasn’t overly romantic,” Fields sad. “It was a really cool healthy dose of romance.”/nLast month, Fields took off four days of work to visit her girlfriend in Gainesville. A year passed since she last saw Hastings, and it was Fields’ turn to make the trek. It was their second anniversary, after all./nOver the weekend, they sipped enough pumpkin juice and butterbeer to make them sick. They rode a dragon rollercoaster, and Hastings was terrified. Fields screamed so much that she drooled. They walked through Hogsmead and Diagon Alley holding hands so they wouldn’t get lost. And if they did, they’d find each other. They did it once before./nHastings is getting ready to move to Bloomington this summer to be closer to Fields. They’re nervous, but in a good way. After two years, they’ll be close enough to work on their bonding. In Florida, they slept in the same bed, but they didn’t cuddle. Fields wants to take it slow. She needs more time./nAs patient as Hastings has been, sometimes Fields worries that she doesn’t feel appreciated./n“Do you feel loved?” Fields asked./n“Yes,” Hastings said./nEven if Fields never experiences romantic feelings for her girlfriend, just being around each other is enough./nClapping shows how much you appreciated Arielle’s story./nEIC of /n.

Practically a punchline in my generation, but it was still a question around the dinner table when we were growing up. (“We” being U.S. Ashkenazis, we descendants of the European Jewish survivors of the pogroms, the ghettos, or the Third Reich. Descendants of the ones who’d made it here in time. We who were all that was left. We remnants.) Underneath the laugh, maybe we meant it a little, or our parents did. Not as much as their parents did — their parents who more intimately knew themselves as Jewish and outsider here, politically and culturally — but there was still that edge of insecurity: How is this going to play out for our people? This political issue? This candidate? This policy? How will it impact our safety? Our survival? We kid, we kid: “the new citywide recycling program — is it good for the Jews?” but we don’t forget the question./nIt is the anniversary of the day Anne Frank and her family were captured, and my seven-year-old’s teacher calls to talk about their class discussion of This Day in History. It’s a mixed-age class of first, second, and third-graders. They got a brief, age-appropriate preçis on bad things happening in wars, how people can act with hate in their hearts, and what happened during that war to people who believed differently or were seen as different. The teacher tells me my daughter was very curious (“camp? Like summer camp?”) and after an absorbing group discussion of diaries, the teacher quickly realized she wanted to develop materials and a longer lesson on this for another time. She says she’s letting me know in case my daughter mentions it at home, since she had so many questions in class. “Yeah, you’ll be surprised to hear this,” I tell the teacher — with whom I serve on the school’s Anti-Racism Anti-Bias Committee, who sees me when we are both out with our families at immigrants’ rights actions and other protests around town, who has invited me to speak to the class about Jewish holidays and traditions, who has heard our kid talk at school about boycotts and huelgas and Black Lives Matter — “but we haven’t actually told A. yet about the Holocaust.” The teacher had gathered as much. “We’ve watched Sound of Music a lot, though. So basically, so far she thinks that Nazis are people who didn’t like Austrians.”/nSometime in the week after the most recent U.S. presidential election, I tell my Chicana, non-Jewish partner that I wish we’d already taught our kid about the Holocaust. She asks me when I’d learned, how old I’d been. I don’t remember learning. I don’t remember not knowing. I remember knowing the word “Hitler” but not knowing what it meant. And I remember reading my mom’s book group copy of Elie Wiesel’s childhood concentration camp memoir /n when I was far too young for it, just because I was a voracious reader and it was small and approachable-looking on the table in the family room. But I don’t remember the conversation that must have happened between those two moments. I don’t remember when or how someone explained to me that the Purim story had a more modern and morbid analogue, in which someone tried to kill us all, and was pretty near successful. But I always knew that however I learned, there was a lot I didn’t want to teach our kid about the Holocaust. I didn’t want the Holocaust to be the foundation of her Jewish identity. I didn’t want to pass on the version of the story in which our people’s historical trauma is understood as a singular victimization that entitles a colonial land grab. And I didn’t want her to think of herself as a Jew just because she would have been counted as one under the Nuremberg Laws. I wanted her to build a positive connection to Jewish religious practice, to Jewish values, to her Ashkenazi and broader Jewish heritage, long before we even talked to her about Europe in the 1930s and 1940s./nSo. November 2016 and still she doesn’t know. “This is going to be so much harder now,” I tell my partner in that first week. Because it is becoming increasingly clear that however we tell her, we can’t tell her the part of the story I hadn’t imagined /n telling her: it happened somewhere else, generations ago, and you are safe./nBut it never has been safe here. Not for the Jews — who know that a place can look safe right up until it isn’t — and not at all. The United States has fundamentally not been a safe place. It is a nation made possible by theft and murder, the theft and murder of human beings, the theft of Indigenous and Brown and Black people’s lands and lives. It has never stopped being that same dangerous place. My Chicana child would not be safe here even if every neo-Nazi saw the light and became a peaceful, equality-loving Quaker tomorrow. And many, many, many other people’s children have never been safe here. Many, many generations of adults have had to parent children through that brutal, daily reality no matter who the president was. Black people, Indigenous people, and other people of color in this country are at elevated risk of physical, financial, and emotional violence every day. It feels to me that it is truly impossible to not know this. Not anymore. Not without a will to not know it. Whatever heightened insecurity folks with skin like mine suddenly have in the current political climate — well, here we are, along with everyone else. Come on in, the water’s filthy. It’s filled with sharks and shipwrecks and toxic waste, oil slicks and flesh-eating bacteria and every kind of death. Keep swimming./nAt bathtime tonight the kid asks me for no apparent reason: what happened in the fight with Austria?/nI spent this morning trying not to react aloud to what I was reading about Friday night in Charlottesville. I spent this afternoon holding babies whose parents were in a community activist meeting on racial equity in our city’s budget. Because I was holding babies, I didn’t read most of my texts until this evening. Before I check on my kid in the tub, I see a news photo of people marching down the street this afternoon holding Confederate and Nazi flags. Another one of people holding torches last night, yelling, sieg-heiling. You’ve seen the ones I mean. And then my kid asks me who won the second World War./nSuch a version of history I absorbed as a child of Boomers: the good guys won. (Shhh, don’t mention Vietnam.) Who won World War II? The Allies. Who won the American Revolution? The Revolutionaries, as my daughter well knows — thanks, /n. Who won the American Civil War? The North. But of course, “war is the continuation of politics by other means” — and politics the continuation of war./nWho won? I am tempted to tell her it’s too soon to say./nWe are reading /n at bedtime. We are almost up to the Peace March chapter. The pushcart peddlers plan to put themselves in the path of the big bully trucks, forcing a bargain./n“/nwith us,” said Harry the Hot Dog. “They would rather run us down — six, twelve, eighteen, /n pushcarts. What do they care how many they hit?”/n“Ah,” said Mr. Jerusalem, “but if they /n hit us, then everyone will /n who is breaking the truce. Who could hit forty carts by accident? I say they will not dare.”/n“But if they do — ?” said Harry the Hot Dog./nMr. Jerusalem shrugged. “Then six, twelve, eighteen, forty pushcarts will be smashed,” he said. “Maybe we will all be killed. It is a war, isn’t it?”/nIt is a war, isn’t it? And it isn’t with Austria. Or with General Lee./nLater, after my girl is asleep, I learn the name of the young anti-racist woman who was run down dead by a white supremacist Nazi today. Her name is Heather Heyer. It takes longer to learn the name of Deandre Harris, the twenty year old Black man whom racists set upon in a parking garage and beat with metal pipes. Longer still to find the name of Marcus Martin, a Black man whose body I saw in the photos, flying though the air off the hood of a car. I cannot find the names of the Black women I saw in the photos, one sitting up on a stretcher, her hands covering her face, another being helped away, her body supported by a Black man walking with her whose name I also cannot find. I do not need to know their names to know that they have names. I do not need to know their names to know I am on their side. It is a war, isn’t it?/n“Don’t read the comments,” everyone says. Maybe it seemed like wise advice until, as many have noted, the U.S. elected a walking Internet comment section to the presidency. And now I’m telling the Jews: read the comments. Texas Senator Ted Cruz posted a statement about Charlottesville in which he condemned racism, Nazis, the KKK, and white supremacists. (That this is itself startling in 2017 is another startling fact about 2017.) The comments section reminded the senator that this was really about the liberal foreigner Jew George Soros paying someone to drive into the counter-protestors, just like he pays BLM. It’s all a vast Jewish conspiracy./nPay attention. This administration is hell-bent on complete deregulation — unfettered access to money and resources for the corporations and their very rich top echelon, and to hell with all the rest of us. Crony capitalism plus demagoguery is a powerful brew, and anti-Semitism and anti-Blackness are both at work in the mix. Eric K. Ward’s excellent /n spells this out. The more the economic elite are consolidating their wealth and power, the more heavily they rely on white supremacy to get the majority of non-rich Americans to go along, and the more use they make of Jews as foils to get away with their corporate robbery in plain sight, without being noticed. It’s possible that this is another useful role Jared Kushner and Steven Miller play as court Jews. (Honestly, though, Steven Miller? And people call /n a self-hating Jew because I’m not a Zionist? Such a one! In the words of Rabbi Aaron Spiegel’s /n, may he be reunited in the world to come with his ancestors, who were all socialist garment workers.)/nThe comments section yells that the people to fear are Black and Brown people, Muslims, immigrants, and queers. The comments section acts like it’s revealing the evil Jewish mastermind behind it all, but that whole narrative actually functions as a desperate shout to pay no attention to the man behind the curtain./nWhen Trump, for example, can blow anti-semitic dog whistles about conspiracies of international bankers, he can distract the public from his own highly dubious financial deals (some of which actually have to do with international loans and some of which are under federal investigation right now)./nGuess what? We Jews aren’t the ones owning and controlling everything. We Jews are not the man behind the curtain. We Jews are the curtain./nWhat difference does it make that the Charlottesville white power riot used symbols and slogans that attack Black folks, Jews, and queers? What does it mean that the white power rioters consider or least present themselves to be victims targeted for erasure by people who have less structural power and privilege than they do?/nLongtime organizer and political researcher Scot Nakagawa has pointed out that this version of racism, which paints the powerful as the victim of the oppressed, takes European anti-semitism as its template. That’s how anti-semitism in Europe often functioned: make the Jews the public face of wealth, put the Jews between the masses and the rulers, and then when needed, trot out the Jews as the threat to “us” all — somehow creating a new “us” that binds together the rulers and the masses, letting the same old class domination keep going in the name of shared victimhood. In today’s U.S., the government’s rhetoric and the rhetoric of the Charlottesville white power rioters invoke the same false “we:” “We Americans” are threatened by immigrants. “We white men” are an endangered species. “We parents” have to keep trans kids out of public bathrooms. Nu, all of this is bad for the Jews./nObviously, people of all faiths, skin colors, and cultural backgrounds should hate anti-Black racism because anti-Blackness is odious. And Jews of all skin colors and cultural backgrounds, Ashkenazi or Sephardic, Mizrahi or Ethiopian, should hate anti-Black racism because racism goes against Jewish values. For Jews who are white-passing, white-privileged, or white-adjacent, there are some additional reasons to hate anti-Black racism: it sets us up and it puts us in danger. A political culture like the one we are living with right now, from D.C. to Charlottesville, to my own town and yours, propagates the idea that the powerful are at risk when the oppressed insist on their rights to live unfettered human lives. Dig deep enough in the soil all around that seed, and you can hear the murmurs that the Jews are to blame./nThe way to protect ourselves and each other is not to wrap the curtain as close as we can get it to the men and women grasping for the most money and power (Betsy DeVos, Erik Prince, Donald Trump, Mike Pence, etc.). It is not to hope that no one notices us and our difference so that we don’t get kicked out of the club. (Even if that weren’t despicable, the Nazis keep showing us it doesn’t work.) The way to protect ourselves and each other is to rip away the curtain, to refuse to stand beside the unjust and powerful to be used as their human shields, and to reject the bad bargain of whiteness./nThe pledge in word and deed is this: We will not sell out our cultures and our comrades, the people whose experiences resonate in our own hearts and the ones we have to struggle to understand, in favor of the false sense of security that comes from temporary proximity to power. We align ourselves with our ancestors and our allies. We side with Black people and Black lives. We side with immigrants. We side with queers and outsiders. We side with Muslims and Sikhs. We side with people who have disabilities and chronic illnesses. We side with people who are poor. We wake up every morning and go out from our homes with the words of Rabbi Hillel on our lips and on our fingers: “If I am not for myself, who will be for me? If I am only for myself, then who am I? And if not now, when?”/nClapping shows how much you appreciated Jen Margulies’s story./nWriter, parent.
https://medium.com/@copyconstruct/small-functions-considered-harmful-91035d316c29	Cindy Sridharan	Small Functions considered Harmful	In this post, I aim to:/n— Shed light on some of the putative benefits of small functions/n — Explain why I personally think some of the benefits don’t really pan out as well as advertised/n — Explain why small functions can actually prove counterproductive/n — Explain the times when I do think smaller functions truly shine/nGeneral programming advice doled out invariably seems to extoll the elegance and efficacy of small functions. The book /noften considered something of a programming bible by many — has a chapter dedicated to functions alone, and the chapter begins with an example of a truly dreadful function that also happens to be long. The book goes on to lay blame on the /nof the function as its most grievous offense, stating that:/nThe chapter briefly ponders what qualities would make the code “/n” and “/n”, before declaring that making the function /n will necessarily achieve this purpose./nThe idea that functions should be small is something that is almost considered too sacrosanct to call into question. It often gets trotted out during code reviews, on Twitter discussions, conference talks, books and podcasts on programming, articles on best practices for refactoring code and so forth. This idea made its merry way into my timeline again a few days ago in the form of this tweet:/nFowler, in his tweet, links to his article on function length, where he goes on to state that:/nThe virtues of small functions are evangelized so very often that it made its way to my timeline again today in the form of this tweet:/nSome people seem so enamored with small functions that the idea of abstracting any and every piece of logic that might seem even nominally complex into a separate function is something that is passionately advocated for./nI’ve worked on codebases inherited from folks who’d internalized this idea to such an unholy extent that the end result was pretty hellish and entirely antithetical to all the good intentions the road to it was paved with. In this post, I hope to explain why some of the oft-touted benefits don’t always pan out the way one hopes and the times when some of the ideas can actually prove to be counterproductive./nA number of reasons usually get wheeled out to prove the merit behind smaller functions./nThe idea is simple — a function should only ever do one thing and do it well. On the face of it, this sounds like an extremely sound idea, in tune, even, with the Unix philosophy./nThe bit where this gets murky is when this “one thing” needs to be defined. The “one thing” can be anything from a simple return statement to a conditional expression to a piece of mathematical computation to a network call. As it so happens, many a time this “one thing” means a single level abstraction of some (often business) logic./nFor instance, in a web application, a CRUD operation like “create user” can be “one thing”. Typically, at the very least, creating a user entails creating a record in the database (and handling any concomitant errors). Additionally, creating a user might also require sending them a welcome email. Furthermore, one might also want to trigger a custom event to a message broker like Kafka to feed this event into various other systems./nThus, a “single level of abstraction” isn’t just a single level. What I’ve seen happen is that programmers who’ve completely bought in to the idea that a function should do “one thing” tend to find it hard to resist the urge to apply the same principle recursively to every function or method they write./nThus, instead of a reasonably airtight abstraction that can be understood (and tested) as a single unit, we now end up with even smaller units that’ve been carved out to delineate each and every component of “the one thing” until it’s fully modular and entirely DRY./nDRY and a propensity to make functions as small as possible aren’t necessarily the same thing, but I’ve observed that the latter does many a time lead to the former. DRY, in my opinion, is a good guiding principle, but an awful lot of times, pragmatism and reason are sacrificed at the altar of a dogmatic adherence to DRY, especially by programmers of the Rails persuasion./nRaymond Hettinger, a core Python developer, has a /ntalk called /nThis talk is a must-watch, not just for Python programmers but for anyone interested in programming or who programs for a living, because it very incisively lays bare the fallacies of a dogmatic adherence to PEP8, which is the Python style guide many linters implement. That the focus of talk is on PEP8 isn’t so much important than the rich insights one can take away from the talk, many of which are language agnostic./nEven if you don’t watch the entire talk, you should watch /n of the talk which draws a frighteningly accurate analogy to the siren call of DRY. Programmers who insist on DRYing up as much of code as possible risk not seeing the forest for the trees./nMy main problem with DRY is that it coerces one into abstractions — nested and premature ones at that. Inasmuch as it’s impossible to abstract /n, the best we can do abstract /ninsofar as we can. Defining “well enough” is hard and is contingent on a large number of factors./nIn the following diagram, the word “abstraction” can be used interchangeably with “function”. For instance, if we’re assuming how best to design the abstraction layer A, we might need to consider the following:/n— the nature of the assumptions underpinning abstraction A and how likely (and for how long) they are likely to hold water/n — the extent to which the layers of abstractions /n abstraction A (abstraction X and abstraction Y) as well as any abstraction built on /n of abstraction A (abstraction Z) are prone to remain consistent, flexible, extensible and correct in their implementation and design/n — the requirements and expectations of any /n abstractions (abstraction M) that might be built on top of the abstraction A and any abstraction that might need to be supported beneath A (abstraction N)/nThe abstraction A we develop is inevitably going to be subject to constant reassessment in the future and in all likelihood partial or even complete invalidation as well. The one /n feature that will stand us in good stead for the inevitable modification that’d be needed is to design our abstraction to be /n./nDRYing up code to the fullest extent possible right now would mean depriving our future selves of the flexibility to accommodate any changes that might be required. What we really should be optimizing for is to allow ourselves enough leeway to make the inevitable changes that will be required sooner or later instead of optimizing for the perfect fit straight away./nThe/nbest abstraction is an abstraction that optimizes for /n, not /n. That’s a feature, not a bug. Understanding this very salient nature of abstractions is the key to designing good ones./nAlex Martelli, the coiner of the phrase /n and famous Pythonista, has a famous talk titled /n, and the /n are well worth a read./nThe fabulous Rubyist Sandi Metz has a famous talk called /n, where she posits that “/n”, and thus to /n./nAbstractions, in my opinion, can’t ever be entirely “right” or “wrong” since the line demarcating “right” from “wrong” is inherently blurred and ever-changing. Our carefully handcrafted artisanal “perfect” abstraction is only one business requirement or bug report away from being consigned to the status of “wrong”./nI think it helps to view abstractions as a spectrum as shown in the diagram we saw earlier in this post. One end of this spectrum optimizes for /n, where every last aspect of our code needs to be /n. This certainly has its fair share of benefits but doesn’t serve well for designing /nabstractions since it strives for a /nThe other end of this spectrum optimizes for imprecision and the lack of boundaries. While this does allow for maximal flexibility, I find this extreme to be prone to other drawbacks./nAs with most other things, “the ideal” lies somewhere in between. There is no one-size-fits-all happy medium. The “ideal” also varies depending on a vast number of factors — both programmatic and interpersonal — and the hallmark of good engineering is to be able to identify where in the spectrum this “ideal” lies for any given context, as well as to constantly re-evaluate and recalibrate this ideal./nSpeaking of abstraction, once it’s decided /n to abstract and /n, it’s important to give it a name./nAnd naming things is /n./nIt’s considered something of a truism in programming that giving things longer, more descriptive names is a good thing, so much so that some even advocate for replacing comments in code with a function bearing the name of the comment. The idea here is that the more descriptive a name, the better the encapsulation./nThis might probably fly in the Java world where verbosity is the norm, but I’ve never particularly found code with such lengthy names easy to read. What could’ve been, say, 4–5 lines of code is now stashed away in a function that bears an extremely long name. When I’m reading code, seeing such a verbose word pop up suddenly gives me pause as I try to process all the different syllables in this function’s name, try to fit it into the mental model I’ve been building thus far and then decide whether or not to investigate the function in greater detail by jumping to its definition and reading the implementation./nThe problem with “small functions” though, is that the quest for small functions ends up begetting /n small functions, all of which tend to be given extremely verbose names in the spirit of making code self documenting and eschewing comments./nAs a result, the cognitive overhead of processing the verbose function (and variable) names, mapping them into the mental model I’ve been building so far, deciding which functions to dig deeper into and which to skim, and piecing together the puzzle to uncover the “big picture” becomes rather difficult./nPersonally, I find keywords, constructs and idioms offered by the programming language much easier from a visual perspective as compared to looking at custom variable or function names. Like for instance, when I’m reading an /n block, I rarely ever spend any mental cycles processing the keywords /n or /n but spend my time understanding the logical flow of the program./nInterrupting my flow of reasoning with /n is a jarring disruption. This is especially true when the function being called is actually a one-liner that can be easily inlined. Context switches are expensive, whether they are CPU context switches or a programmer having to mentally switch context while reading code./nThe other problem with a surfeit of small functions, especially ones with very descriptive and unintuitive names is that the codebase is now harder to /n. A function named /n is easy and intuitive to grep for, something like /n (an name held up as a shining example in the book /n), by contrast, is not the most easily memorable name or the most searchable. Many editors also do a fuzzy search of the codebase, so having too many functions with similar prefixes is also more likely to pull up an extraneous number of results while searching, which is hardly ideal./nSmall functions work best when we don’t have to jump across file or package boundaries to find the definition of a function. The book /nproposes something called /nto this end./nThis sounds great in theory but rarely have I seen it play out well in practice. Instead, what I /nseen almost invariably is the loss of locality as more functions are added to the code./nLet’s assume we start out with three functions, A, B and C, each which is called (and ergo read) one after the other. Our initial abstractions were underpinned by certain assumptions, requirements and caveats, all of which we assiduously researched and reasoned about during the time of initial design./nSoon enough, let’s say we have a new requirement pop up or an edge case we hadn’t foreseen or a new constraint we need to cater to. We need to modify function A since “the one thing” it encapsulates isn’t valid anymore (or wasn’t ever valid to begin with and now we need to rectify it). In-keeping with what we’ve read in /n, we decide the best way to deal with this is to, well, create /n /n that will hide away the messy new requirements that’ve cropped up./nA couple of weeks after we’ve made this change, if our requirements change yet again, we might need to create /nfunctions to encapsulate all the additional changes required./nRinse and repeat, and we’ve arrived exactly at the problem Sandi Metz describes in her post on /n. The post goes on to state that:/nWhile this might be true when the same team that originally worked on the codebase continues maintaining it, I’ve seen the opposite play out when new programmers (or managers) take ownership of the codebase. What started out with good intentions has now turned into spaghetti code that sure as hell ain’t /nanymore, and now the urge to “refactor” or sometimes even rewrite the code becomes all the more tempting./nNow one might argue that, to a certain extent, this is inevitable. And they’d be right. What we rarely talk about is how important it is to write code that will die a graceful death. I’ve written in the past about how important it is to make code operationally easy to decommission, but this is even more true when it comes to the codebase itself./nAll too often, programmers think of code as “dead” only if it’s deleted or not in use anymore or if the service itself is decommissioned. If we start thinking about the code we write as something that dies /n, I think we might be more incentivized to write code that’s amenable to easy modification. When thinking about how to abstract, it greatly helps to be cognizant of the fact that the code we’re building might probably only be a few hours away from dying (being modified). Thus optimizing for /n of code tends to work better than trying to build topdown narratives of the sort proposed in /n./nSmaller functions also lead to either larger classes or just more number of classes in languages that support Object Oriented Programming. In the case of a language like Go, I’ve seen this tendency lead to larger interfaces (combined with the double whammy of /n) or a large number of tiny packages./nThis exacerbates the cognitive overhead involved in mapping the business logic to the abstractions we’ve carved out. The more the number of classes/interfaces/packages, the harder it is to “take it all in” in one fell swoop, which does zilch to justify the maintenance cost of these various classes/interfaces/packages we’ve built./nProponents of smaller functions also almost invariably tend to champion that /n be passed to the function./nThe problem with fewer function arguments is that one runs the risk of not making dependencies explicit./nI’ve definitely seen Ruby classes with 5–10 tiny methods, all which typically do something very trivial and take maybe a parameter or two as arguments. I’ve also seen a lot of them mutate shared global state or rely on singletons not explicitly passed to them, which is an anti-pattern if ever there was one./nFurthermore, when the dependencies aren’t explicit, testing becomes a /ninto the bargain, what with the overhead of setting up and tearing down state before every individual test targeting our itty-bitty functions can be run./nThis has already been stated before but it bears reiterating — an explosion of small functions, especially one line functions, makes the codebase /n harder to read. This especially hurts those for whom the code should’ve been /n for in the first place — newcomers./nThere are several types of newcomers to a codebase. A good rule of thumb, in my experience, has been to keep in mind someone who might check a number of the aforementioned categories of “new”. Doing so helps me re-evaluate my assumptions and rethink the overhead I might be inadvertently imposing on someone new who’ll be reading the code for the first time. What I’ve realized is that this approach actually leads to far /ncode than might’ve been possible otherwise./nSimple code isn’t necessarily the easiest code to write, and rarely is it ever the DRYest code. It takes an enormous amount of careful thought, attention to detail and care to arrive at the simplest solution that is both correct and easy to reason about. What is most striking about such hard-won simplicity is that it lends itself to being easily understood by both old /n new programmers, for all possible definitions of “old” and “new”./nWhen I’m “new” to a codebase, if I’m fortunate enough to already know the language and/or the framework being used, the biggest challenge for me is to understand the business logic or implementation details. When I’m not so fortunate and am faced with the daunting task of manoeuvring my way through a codebase written in a language foreign to me, the biggest challenge I face is to walk a tightrope between understanding /nof the language/framework so as to be able to make sense of what the code is doing without going down a rabbit hole and at the same time being able to isolate the “one single thing” of interest that I’d need understand to make the necessary progress to move the project to the next stage./nDuring neither of these times have I ever looked at an unfamiliar codebase and thought:/nWhat I’m really hoping for during the times I venture into uncharted territory is to make the /nnumber of mental hops and context switches while trying to find the answer to a question./nInvesting time and thought into making things easy for the future maintainer or consumer of the code is something that will have a huge pay-off, especially for open source projects. This is something I wish I’d done better earlier in my career and is something I’m very mindful of these days./nAll things considered, I do believe small functions absolutely have their utility, especially when it comes to testing./nThis isn’t a post on how to best write functional, integration and unit tests for a vast number of services. However, when it comes to unit tests, the way network I/O is tested is by, well, not /n testing it./nI’m not a terribly big fan of mocks. Mocks have several shortcomings. For one thing, mocks are an artificial simulation of some result. Mocks are only as good as our imagination and our ability to predict the various failure modes our application might encounter. Mocks are also very likely to get out of sync from the real service they stand-in for, unless one painstakingly/ntests every mock against the real service. Mocks also work best when there is just a single instance of every particular mock and every test uses the same mock./nThat said, mocks are still pretty much the only way one can unit-test network I/O. We live in an era of microservices and outsourcing most (if not all) of the concerns not core to our main product to a vendor. A lot of an application’s core functionality now involves a network call or five, and the best way to unit-test these calls is by mocking them out./nOn the whole, I find /n the surface area of mocks to the /nto/nwork best. An API call to an email service to send our newly created user a welcome email requires making an HTTP connection. Isolating this request to the smallest possible function allows us to mock the least amount of code in tests. Typically, this should be a function with no more than 1–2 lines to make the HTTP connection and return any error along with the response. The same is applicable when publishing an event to Kafka or creating a new user in the database./nFor something that can provide such an enormous amount of benefit with such little code, property based testing is woefully underused. Pioneered by the Haskell library QuickCheck and gaining adoption in other languages like Scala and Python, property based testing allows one to generate a large number of inputs that match some specification to a given test and assert that the test passes for each and every one of these cases./nMany property based testing frameworks target /n and as such it makes sense to isolate anything that can subjected to property based testing to a single function. I find this especially useful while testing the encoding or decoding of data, or testing JSON/msgpack parsing and so forth./nThis post’s intention was neither to argue that DRY nor small functions are inherently bad (even if the title disingenuously suggested so). Only that they aren’t inherently /neither./nThe number of small functions in a codebase or the average function length in itself isn’t a metric to brag about. There’s a 2016 Pycon talk called /nabout an eponymous Python program that can convert /nPython program (including itself) into a single line of code. While this makes for a fun and fascinating conference talk, one would be rather silly to write production code in the same matter./nIn the words of one of the best programmers of our time:/nThis applies universally, not just to Go. As the complexity of the programs we author has greatly increased and the constraints we work against have become all the more protean, it behooves programmers to adapt their thinking accordingly./nProgramming orthodoxy, unfortunately, remains heavily influenced by books written during an era when Object Oriented Programming and “Design Patterns” reigned supreme. A lot of these ideas and best practices promulgated have largely gone unchallenged for decades now and direly require reconsideration, especially so since the programming landscape as well as paradigms have evolved vastly in the recent years. Wheeling out old tropes is not only lazy but also lulls programmers into a false sense of reassurance they can ill-afford./nClapping shows how much you appreciated Cindy Sridharan’s story./n on Twitter
https://medium.com/@SonofBaldwin/hush-hush-sweet-charlottesville-5d200fb46827	Son of Baldwin	Hush, Hush Sweet Charlottesville	Because of the incessant news cycle that generally shares as much nonsense as it does news, it’s virtually impossible to have escaped the most recent events in Charlottesville, Virginia. A few nights ago, a large group of “white nationalists” — which is, apparently, the new-millennium euphemism for “bigots” — marched on the campus of the University of Virginia (UVA). With citronella torches in hand, evoking the white-supremacist lynch mobs, cross burners, and the deadly nighttime raids that we Americans have convinced ourselves are relics of a distant past, they shouted: “White lives matter!” and “You will not replace us!” (the latter of which /n). To whom were they speaking? Whom do they believe is out to replace them? The answers to those questions are quite clear. They were speaking to anyone who isn’t white and Christian, and that is who they fear will replace them./nThe fear stems from the truth that they can neither face nor hide: /n. Its death has nothing to do with black people or Jews or Native Americans or feminists or Mexicans or LGBTQ people or Muslims or disabled people or any other group they wish to scapegoat and project upon. This is a Christian enterprise. White America is dying of suicide, and maybe something a tad more mystical, but no less concrete: karma. We’ve all seen the research and statistics irrefutably illustrating how white communities are being destroyed by /n; how /n; how /n; how /n even as /n because they hate the black president who gave it to them more than they love being alive. They’re reading the same studies we all are, which show not only that the /n of said products, but also /n — which, if their protest signs are any indication — /n; ironic given who the /n actually are./nAnd this fear — this looming, omnipresent fear — f/n the next morning. Armed with flagpoles that held Confederate flags and flags with swastikas, chanting the imperialist, Antisemitic, Nazi slogan, “blood and soil,” these white men and women — emboldened by the /n of the /n, whose name isn’t worth utterance, and his a/n — stormed the town in a rally that /n, though few news outlets, for reasons that are woefully transparent, were willing to call it such. Not even one of the /n were called thugs or criminals by the media or political pundits. /n; they didn’t bring out military artillery and tanks; they didn’t bomb the rioters with tear gas; there were no mass arrests of those involved. And many of these people, unlike Black Lives Matter protesters, /n./nThis stands in stark contrast to how Black Lives Matter protests are handled and regarded. Unlike the Charlottesville protest, Black Lives Matter protests are not formed in the interest of denigrating other human beings. On the contrary, the purpose of Black Lives Matter is to insist upon the humanity of black people in a society that neglects to acknowledge this fundamental and irrefutable truth. And yet, the country looks upon such an entreaty with great disdain and purposely misinterprets it to invent offense. “Black lives matter” means “black lives matter, /n,” but to most white people — from the average citizen to those with political power — misconstrue it to mean “/n black lives matter,” and act, with vicious and deadly intent, on the deliberate misconception./nEven as one of the white supremacists used a car to /n, turning the riot into a bloodbath, many white politicians hemmed and hawed about whether it was fair to blame the white supremacist protesters for the actions of one of them, imploring the country to “wait for the facts.” /n and the apologists remained comfortable in their state of irresponsibility. These are the same people who, of course, /n But white Americans, irrespective of what they do or don’t do, will always be afforded an individuality, humanity, and presumption of innocence that other people will not. And that’s because there are too few people willing to articulate a stone-cold truth for fear of losing some material status or item that they believe falsehoods help them maintain:/nThe American project, /n, is built upon bigoted principles./nChristopher Columbus came here to /n. Those who first came to America to escape European tyranny didn’t see the contradiction in kidnapping, raping, whipping, enslaving, and Christianizing boatloads of Africans. It is fitting — and telling — that the white supremacists chose Charlottesville, the home of /n and /n, both of whom embodied each one of the deadly and hypocritical characteristics outlined. Terrorists, after all, beget terrorists. These are the wages of Whiteness./nIn this, the mainstream media has been wholly complicit by /n; that the ideas, themselves, are equal; that bigotry is simply a harmless opinion that freedom should protect as rigorously as any rational one. And in auto/visual spaces around the world, /n; that there is no connection between the country’s violence abroad and violence on its own shores; that bigotry isn’t, in fact, an American virtue; that the few actual witnesses in the audience who can recognize a fabrication when it’s placed before them should trust paid liars over their own senses. /n /nThe downfall of America will be this and simply this: Its inability to reckon with its history — whether that is those on the so-called right who believe, in their heart of shriveled little hearts, in the name of White Jesus, that John Wayne and /n are, in fact, reality; those on the so-called left who actually believe that United Colors of Benetton is something other than a capitalist enterprise designed to sell more clothes to more people; or those residing somewhere safely in the middle who are terrified of action and accountability./nTheir misapprehensions ensure that the end will come not with the promised /n, but with the hush of a vengeance that has waited for just this moment in the country’s pathological slumber to give it precisely what it refuses to believe it has earned./nClapping shows how much you appreciated Son of Baldwin’s story./nTo the tick-tock and you don’t stop. Writing for my life. And perhaps yours. Disturbing the peace in order to find it. No sleep ’til Crooklyn. Let’s get free.
https://medium.com/@sgriddle/im-35-and-i-may-suddenly-have-lost-the-rest-of-my-life-i-m-panicking-just-a-bit-35d6a28dcbc	Scott Riddle	I’m 35 and I may suddenly have lost the rest of my life. I’m panicking, just a bit.	It’s been a while since I put a piece of writing in the public domain, but suddenly I have a lot to get off my chest, well my colon actually./nJust three weeks ago life was good. Correction. It was awesome. The newest edition to our family had arrived on Christmas Eve, joining his two sisters aged 5 and 3. A month later we were on a plane home to Sydney, having spent four great years working for Google in California. My beautiful wife had been working at a startup on NASA’s Moffett campus and was worried about finding something equally interesting in Australia, but she managed to land a very similar gig with an innovative logistics start-up in Sydney. We’d come back primarily to be closer to family, but also to pursue a dream of setting up a family farm in partnership with my parents — intended as a great place to bring up our three kids but also as a new sideline income stream. We’d spent every weekend scouring Sydney for areas that met our criteria (good schools, commutable, cost of land etc) and we were settling on /n in Sydney’s west. I was just getting into a training routine for the /n run having done the /n a few months prior./nI’m 35 years old./nOn July 19th I went for what I thought would be a routine GP visit. In my mind it was primarily to re-establish a GP relationship in case my kids needed an urgent care visit (the practice is literally around the corner from our place). I’d also noticed a bit of unusual bleeding from, well, my back passage and very recently a change in bowel habit. I wasn’t alarmed by either of these symptoms but my GP was concerned enough to refer me for a colonoscopy. So began the roller coaster./nI’ll skip much of the detail but in short the colonoscopy revealed a lesion which they believed to be malignant. This was confirmed by a biopsy three days later. A CT scan revealed suspicious swelling in the surrounding lymph nodes so I was booked for a PET CT scan — where radioactive sugar is injected prior to a CT scan to highlight cancer in your body. That PET scan changed the game because it not only confirmed cancer in the surrounding lymph nodes but it also found two smaller tumors in my liver, which the original scan had not identified. So, by August 2nd I was confronted with a stage 4 colorectal cancer diagnosis./nNow for those (like me) who are not all that familiar with cancer, you never just “have cancer”. Cancer is really the name given to a broad family of related diseases. There is also a fairly well established methodology for measuring the progress of any cancer. Here’s the short version:/nThese days having a stage 1 cancer is generally no big deal. Stage 4 however is not too good at all. Doctors use ‘survival curves’ — survival statistics for people with your cancer and your stage of progression — to provide some kind of prognosis. In my case, most published survival curves suggest that only 10% of people are still alive 5 years post diagnosis. Now, I’ve since learnt that there are many reasons not to focus too much on these statistics. My prognosis is likely better (none of my doctors will venture a guess) but it is no better than 50/50. And even if I live beyond 5 years, my life expectancy as a survivor of metastatic cancer will almost certainly be much curtailed./nOver the next 6 months I’ll be doing radio therapy and chemotherapy and at some point I’ll have two surgeries, one to remove a section of my colon and the other to remove two chunks from my liver. This for a guy who’s never been seriously sick in his adult life, and who happens to have a major needle phobia./nI know this is so cliched, but life really can change overnight. Suddenly I can’t be sure I’m going to see my new son’s 5th birthday, or even his 2nd. It’s now highly unlikely I’ll see even my eldest daughter get married. I probably won’t know what careers my children pursue. And as for my own career, it’s come to a screeching halt. I’m also struggling to imagine what it might look like in future if I do manage to survive this, because my outlook on life is already so fundamentally altered I don’t think I can just go back to my old world./nLife now is a weird kind of duality./nOn the one hand I must be optimistic — I must believe I can beat this cancer to get through the next six months. On the other hand I need to be pragmatic and prepared for a scenario where the treatment is unsuccessful and I’m told one day that I have X months to live. As a husband and dad of three kids under five that scenario is obviously terrifying, but it also has many practical implications that I feel I need to prepare for — financial readiness, a mechanism to ensure my children remember me, legal authority for my wife over our assets, etc./nOne of the things I’m struggling most with is this concept of legacy. I’m a planner. Before this diagnosis I’d been thinking of my 1st 35 years — aside from being a ton of fun and travel — as preparation. I felt like I was building a platform (savings, networks, skills, experience) that I could then use in my second act to make a real contribution, to “make my mark”, to build a real legacy for my kids. Perhaps that was a mistake on my part, because I may have no time to do that now. I guess I’m panicking a little./nI feel like I have so many messages to deliver to the blissful masses from my now precarious vantage point, from the importance of early precautionary doctor visits to the merits of life insurance. But putting pragmatism aside, there is one thing I’d urge everyone to do. Stop just assuming you have a full lifetime to do whatever it is you dream of doing. I know it sounds ridiculously cliched, and of course you never think it will happen to you, but let me assure you that life really can be taken from you at any time, so live it with that reality in mind./nOh, and please stop complaining about the small stuff !/nClapping shows how much you appreciated Scott Riddle’s story./nLong time Google employee. Father of three. Passionate about purpose 1st business. Taking a leave of absence to fight stage 4 colon cancer.
